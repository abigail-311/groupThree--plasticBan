        Banning plastic bags are a very important step in tackling the plastic crisis. <li> As plasticis not recyclable its production, use and disposal are bad for human health and also the environment</li>
        <li>Discarded plastic bags pose a threat for marine life, wildlife and are harmful for agriculture when they mix when they mix with the soil as they are non - biodegradable</li>
        <li>The plastic bags are made from non renewable and this highly contributes to climate change <li>
        <li>Long term exposure of plastic to air, water and sunlight releases highly toxic pollutants and emmits harmful gases into the atmosphere </li> 
        <li>banning plastic bags will result in reduced plasyic trash every year</li>
        <li>As plastic bags are manufactured using petroleum, banning them will result in putting the resource to better use</li>
        <li>Cotton jute and paper bags are better alternatives to plastic bags</li>
        <li>According to the United Nations environment program Rwanda, a pioneer in banning single use plastic bags is now one of the cleanest nations on Earth</li></font>

        <li>The ban on plastic bags does not necessarily mean that it's use will cease </li>
        <li>The ban is only to control individual use of plastic bags because people are irresponsible when it comes to disposal, thus causing environmental pollution</li>
        <li>As plastic bags are not disposed properly, they degrade the quality of the soil, thus causing soil pollution</li>
        <li>This makes the soil infertile and hence, affects agriculture</li>
        <li>So, plastic bags need to be banned to save soil and ultimately the environment</li>
        <li>The ban will regulate the distribution of plastic bags only to heavy duty and at a fee</li>
        <li>Different states came up with the different laws at varying points of time</li>
        <li>However what is pitiable is the fact that ever since ban on plastic bags were introduced most shopping stores ended up making these bags chargeable</li></font>
